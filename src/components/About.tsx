          I'm a Computer Science student passionate about building innovative
          solutions that make a difference. My journey in technology started with
          simple HTML websites and has evolved into developing complex applications
          using modern frameworks and technologies.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Currently focusing on artificial intelligence and web development, I'm
          always eager to learn new technologies and tackle challenging problems.
          When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source
          projects or attending tech meetups.
