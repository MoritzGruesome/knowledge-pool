        My name is Moritz Gr√ºss and I am currently studying Information and Communication Technology in Stockholm. Lately,
        I've been really interested in Machine Learning. I find it fascinating how data and algorithms can be used to create intelligent systems, and 
        I'm excited to explore more about how ML can be applied in different areas.

          myself, or in collaboration with other students/friends.
